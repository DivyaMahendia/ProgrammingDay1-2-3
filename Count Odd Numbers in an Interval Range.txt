Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        int count=0;
        for (int i=low;i<=high;i++)
            if(i%2!=0)
              count++; 
        
        
        return count;
            
    }
};
